    <h1>Lizard</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than <a href="none">snakes</a> (and to a lesser extent
      amphisbaenians), encompassing over 7,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as
      well as most oceanic island chains. The grouping is paraphyletic as some lizards are more closely
      related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few
      centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as
      "legless lizards") have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some lizards, such
      as the forest-dwelling Draco, are able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off
      other males and signalling, often with bright colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals.
      Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects,
      while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding,
      and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails.

    <h2>Anatomy</h2>

    <p>
      The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as
      Brookesia micra and geckos such as Sphaerodactylus ariasae[2] to nearly 3 m (10 ft) in the case of the
      largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo dragon.[3] Most lizards are fairly small animals.

    <h2>Physiology</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Locomotion</h3>
    <p>
      Aside from legless lizards, most lizards are quadrupedal and move using gaits with alternating movement
      of the right and left limbs with substantial body bending. This body bending prevents significant
      respiration during movement, limiting their endurance, in a mechanism called Carrier's constraint.
      Several species can run bipedally,[10] and a few can prop themselves up on their hindlimbs and tail
      while stationary. Several small species such as those in the genus Draco can glide: some can attain a
      distance of 60 metres (200 feet), losing 10 metres (33 feet) in height.[11] Some species, like geckos
      and chameleons, adhere to vertical surfaces including glass and ceilings.[9] Some species, like the
      common basilisk, can run across water.[12]
    </p>
    <h3>Senses</h3>
    <p>
      Lizards make use of their senses of sight, touch, olfaction and hearing like other vertebrates. The
      balance of these varies with the habitat of different species; for instance, skinks that live largely
      covered by loose soil rely heavily on olfaction and touch, while geckos depend largely on acute vision
      for their ability to hunt and to evaluate the distance to their prey before striking. Monitor lizards
      have acute vision, hearing, and olfactory senses. Some lizards make unusual use of their sense organs:
      chameleons can steer their eyes in different directions, sometimes providing non-overlapping fields of
      view, such as forwards and backwards at once. Lizards lack external ears, having instead a circular
      opening in which the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can be seen. Many species rely on hearing for early
      warning of predators, and flee at the slightest sound.[13]
